Diabetes Prediction Data Analysis Project
Overview:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters and demographic factors. 
Leveraging machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis, this project seeks to uncover insights into the relationships between different features and the risk of diabetes.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis contains anonymized health data from individuals, including attributes such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, glucose levels, and other relevant factors. 
Each record in the dataset is labeled with the presence or absence of diabetes.

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization where necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and any patterns that may exist between variables.
Feature Engineering: Engineer new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive performance of the model.
Model Selection: Evaluate and compare different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines for their effectiveness in predicting diabetes.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train the selected model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Validation: Validate the final model using cross-validation techniques to ensure its generalizability and robustness.
Results:
The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing the risk of diabetes and develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into diabetic or non-diabetic categories.
The performance of the model will be evaluated based on its ability to correctly predict diabetes cases while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
